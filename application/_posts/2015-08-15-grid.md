Let's build a responsive grid. A responsive grid should allow us to position elements within a grid, and to indicate
how many elements should be in each row of the grid for different media queries.

## The non repsonsive grid

This is suprisingly easy to accomplish with sass. Let's start by first implementing a non responsive grid, and then 
adding the responsive elements later. We'll begin by deciding on the class names that will control the grid. We'll use
the format `span-total`. For example this will be for an element that spans one column in a grid 6 columns wide: `.col-1-6`,
and this is an element tha that spans 7 columns in a grid that's 12 columns wide: `.col-7-12`. Also. we'll support at most
12 columns. This means the max span is 12, and since sass allows looping we can nest the loops to produce our classes:

```sass
@for $span from 1 through 12 {
    @for $total from 1 through 12 {
        .col-#{$span}-#{$total} {
            width: percentage($span / $total);
        }
    }
}
```

If you want to console log in sass just use `@debug`: `@debug 'Now creating class: .col-#{$span}-#{$total}.'`.

Of course the above could be cleaned up to have fewer classes, which is a good thing in terms of css file size. For example - 
since we are using percent widths - there is no reason to have both a `.col-1-2` and a `.col-2-4` class, since they are
both `50%` wide.

To finish up we just have to float the divs next to each other, and to make things easier to read we can move the creation
of classes into a mixin:

```sass
@mixin columns {
    @for $span from 1 through 12 {
        @for $total from 1 through 12 {
            .col-#{$span}-#{$total} {
                width: percentage($span / $total);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And now floating the elements is easy to read:

```sass
.grid {
    > * {
        float: left;
        @include columns;
    }
}
```

## The responsive grid

Now let's add the ability to target our classes to specific media queries.

There's a [great Sitepoint article](http://www.sitepoint.com/managing-responsive-breakpoints-sass/) about managing 
responsive break points with SASS. Let's add the mixin:

```sass
@mixin respond-to($name) {
    // If the key exists in the map
    @if map-has-key($breakpoints, $name) {
        // Prints a media query based on the value
        @media #{inspect(map-get($breakpoints, $name))} {
            @content;
        }
    }
    // If the key doesn't exist in the map
    @else {
        @warn "Unfortunately, no value could be retrieved from `#{$name}`. "
            + "Please make sure it is defined in `$breakpoints` map.";
    }
}
```

And after we decide on our breakpoints:

```sass
$breakpoints: (
    'small'  : ( min-width:  568px ),
    'medium' : ( min-width:  768px ),
    'large'  : ( min-width: 1024px ),
    'xlarge' : ( min-width: 1280px )
);
```

We can now use the mixin as follows:

```sass
.example {

    // mobile first 100% width
    width : 100%;
    
    @mixin respond-to('medium') {
        // if medium or bigger, 50% width
        width: 50%;
    }
}
```

To add this into our column mixin, we can just at the breakpoint name to the column class:

```sass
// $point is the name of the break point we want to use
// by default there is no break point being applied
@mixin column($point:false) {

  @for $span from 1 through 12 {
    @for $total from 1 through 12 {
      @if ($point) {
        .col-#{$point}-#{$span}-#{$total} {
          width: percentage($span / $total);
        }
      } @else {
        .col-#{$span}-#{$total} {
          width: percentage($span / $total);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And now we can add one more loop outside the span and total loops that is the media queries loop:

```sass
@mixin columns() {

    // First we include the columns class with no media query    
    @include column();

    // Then we include column classes with all the individual media queries
    @each $point in map_keys($breakpoints) {
        @include respond-to($point) {
            @include column($point);
        }
    }
}
```

These simple css classes allow the building of a well controlled photo album. Here is the jade:

```jade
    .grid
        .col-1-1.col-small-1-2.col-medium-1-3.col-large-1-4.col-xlarge-1-5
            img(href="...", alt="photo 1")
        .col-1-1.col-small-1-2.col-medium-1-3.col-large-1-4.col-xlarge-1-5 
            img(href="...", alt="photo 2")
        .col-1-1.col-small-1-2.col-medium-1-3.col-large-1-4.col-xlarge-1-5 
            img(href="...", alt="photo 3")
        .col-1-1.col-small-1-2.col-medium-1-3.col-large-1-4.col-xlarge-1-5 
            img(href="...", alt="photo 4")
        .col-1-1.col-small-1-2.col-medium-1-3.col-large-1-4.col-xlarge-1-5 
            img(href="...", alt="photo 5")
```

Hopefully this gives you some ideas around how existing css frameworks make use of sass to build there css, and it also
should give you some ideas on how to create your own custom layout css with sass.
